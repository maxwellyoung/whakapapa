# Whakapapa Marketing Strategy

## Positioning

**One-liner:** An AI-powered family knowledge base that turns old letters, photos, and stories into a living family tree.

**Elevator pitch:** Whakapapa helps you preserve your family's stories before they're lost. Drop in a photo of grandma's letter or a birth certificate — AI extracts names, dates, and relationships automatically. Record stories in someone's own voice. Build a beautiful, shareable family tree. Open source, privacy-first.

**Target audiences:**
1. **Genealogy hobbyists** — already using Ancestry.com, MyHeritage, FamilySearch but want something modern, open-source, and AI-powered
2. **Māori & Pacific families** — oral tradition is central; voice recording + story capture is a killer feature
3. **Indie hackers / developers** — open source, modern stack, interesting AI use case
4. **Families with aging relatives** — urgency to capture stories before they're lost

## Key Differentiators

| Us | Ancestry.com / MyHeritage |
|----|--------------------------|
| AI extracts data from any document | Manual data entry |
| Voice recording built in | No voice features |
| Open source (MIT) | Proprietary, subscription-locked |
| Modern UI (Next.js, React Flow) | Legacy web interfaces |
| Cultural sensitivity (Māori roots) | Western-centric |
| Self-hostable | Cloud-only |
| Free | $20-50/month |

## Launch Channels

### Tier 1 — High Impact, Do First

#### 🚀 Product Hunt
- **When:** After landing page is polished + have screenshots/demo
- **Prep needed:** 
  - Thumbnail/logo (the 🌿 works great)
  - 5+ screenshots or a demo video
  - Maker comment telling the personal story
  - Rally 5-10 friends to upvote on launch day
- **Angle:** "I built an AI-powered family tree app because I was afraid my grandparents' stories would be lost"

#### 💻 Hacker News (Show HN)
- **Format:** "Show HN: Whakapapa – AI-powered family knowledge base (open source)"
- **Post content:** Personal story + what it does + tech stack + GitHub link
- **Timing:** Tuesday-Thursday, ~10am EST
- **What HN loves:** Open source, interesting tech (Claude AI + OCR + genealogy), cultural angle, solo dev story
- **Warning:** Don't be salesy. Be technical and genuine.

#### 🐙 GitHub
- **README is already excellent** — just needs screenshots
- **Add:** Demo GIF, "Star us!" badge, social preview image
- **Topics/tags:** genealogy, family-tree, ai, nextjs, supabase, open-source, maori, whakapapa

### Tier 2 — Community-Specific

#### 🧬 Genealogy Communities
- **FamilySearch Community** — they love open source tools
- **Genealogy forums** (genealogy.com, rootschat.com) — share as a tool, not self-promo
- **r/Genealogy** — ⚠️ CAREFUL (Maxwell's Reddit rule). Only if Maxwell explicitly approves the exact post.
- **Facebook groups** — "Genealogy Addicts", "DNA & Genealogy" (huge groups, 100k+ members)

#### 🇳🇿 NZ / Māori Communities
- **NZ tech community** — NZ tech Twitter, Startup NZ Slack
- **Māori innovation spaces** — Te Hiku Media, Callaghan Innovation
- **Local press** — NZ Herald tech section, Newsroom, The Spinoff (indie NZ tech story)
- **Angle:** "NZ developer builds open-source app named after Māori concept of genealogy"

#### 🛠️ Indie Hacker Communities
- **IndieHackers.com** — product page + community post
- **Twitter/X** — build in public thread
- **DEV.to** — technical blog post about the AI extraction pipeline
- **Buildspace** — if they have a current cohort

### Tier 3 — Ongoing / Content

#### 📝 Blog Posts (for SEO + sharing)
1. "Why I named my app after a Māori word" — cultural, personal
2. "Using Claude AI to extract genealogical data from old documents" — technical
3. "The tech stack behind a modern family tree app" — developer audience
4. "How to start recording your family's stories (before it's too late)" — emotional, shareable

#### 🎥 Demo Video
- 60-second walkthrough: scan a document → AI extracts → family tree updates
- Post on YouTube, embed on landing page, share on socials

## Content Calendar (Suggested)

| Week | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Week 1** | Finish landing page, take screenshots, write PH listing |
| **Week 2** | Launch on Product Hunt + Show HN same week |
| **Week 3** | Blog post #1 (naming story) + IndieHackers |
| **Week 4** | NZ press outreach + genealogy communities |
| **Ongoing** | Build in public on Twitter, weekly updates |

## Copy Bank

### Headlines
- "Your family's stories deserve more than a dusty photo album"

- "From old letters to living history"

### Social Posts (Templates)

**Product Hunt:**
> 🌿 Whakapapa — an AI-powered family knowledge base
> 
> I built this because I realized my grandparents' stories were slipping away. Drop in a photo of an old letter, and AI extracts names, dates, relationships. Record stories in someone's own voice. Build a beautiful family tree.
> 
> Open source. Free. Built with Next.js, Supabase, and Claude AI.

**Hacker News:**
> Show HN: Whakapapa – Open-source AI-powered family knowledge base
>
> I've been building an app to help preserve family history. It uses Claude to extract genealogical data from scanned documents (OCR via Tesseract.js → text → Claude extraction). Also has voice recording, interactive family tree (dagre + React Flow), GEDCOM import, and shareable links.
>
> Named after the Māori word for genealogy — I'm from New Zealand and wanted to honor how Māori culture treats ancestry as living story, not just names on a chart.
>
> Stack: Next.js 16, Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Storage), Claude API, React Flow, Framer Motion.
>
> GitHub: [link]
> Live: [link]

**Twitter thread:**
> 🧵 I built an AI-powered family tree app and named it after a Māori word. Here's why:
>
> 1/ "Whakapapa" (fa-ka-pa-pa) is the Māori word for genealogy. But it's deeper than that — it's about the living connections between people across generations. Not just names and dates, but stories.
>
> 2/ The problem: my grandparents have amazing stories. But no one's writing them down. Old letters sit in boxes. Photos have no names on the back. Every year, more context is lost.
>
> 3/ So I built something. Drop in a photo of an old letter → OCR reads it → Claude AI extracts names, dates, relationships → they appear in your family tree. Magic.

## Metrics to Track
- GitHub stars (vanity but useful for credibility)
- Sign-ups / active workspaces
- Landing page → sign-up conversion rate
- Referral sources
- Document scans / AI extractions (product engagement)

## Budget: $0
Everything here is free or sweat equity. No paid ads needed at this stage — organic + community is the play.
